# Deploying the Athean demo site to Vercel

The marketing site lives at `apps/web` inside the monorepo.
`apps/web/vercel.json` wires the pnpm + Turborepo build pipeline so
Vercel can build only the Next.js workspace member from inside a
pnpm-managed monorepo.

## One-time setup

1. Push the repo to GitHub (`origin/main`).
2. Sign in to <https://vercel.com> with the GitHub account that owns
   the repo. (Hobby tier; no credit card required.)
3. Click **Add New → Project**.
4. Select the Athean-Trades repository.
5. **Important:** when the wizard offers a Turborepo / monorepo
   project layout that lists every `services/*` Python dir as a
   separate Web Service, do **not** pick that. Choose Application
   Preset = **Other** at the top so you create a single project.
6. Override **Root Directory** to `apps/web`.
7. Framework preset auto-detects as **Next.js**.
8. The build commands come from `apps/web/vercel.json` — no manual
   overrides needed:
   ```
   installCommand:  cd ../.. && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   buildCommand:    cd ../.. && pnpm turbo run build --filter=@athean/web...
   outputDirectory: .next
   ```
   The `cd ../..` jumps back to the repo root so pnpm sees the
   workspace + lockfile + Turborepo config.
9. Hit **Deploy**. First build takes ~3 minutes (pnpm install + turbo
   build). Subsequent builds are cached and finish in ~30 seconds.

The site lands at `https://<project-name>.vercel.app`. Every PR auto-
gets a preview URL.

## Environment variables

The marketing landing and `/demo` replay do not require any env vars.

The `/dashboard` route calls the FastAPI gateway. If you want it to
work from Vercel, expose your gateway at a public URL and set:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.pantheon.example.com
```

For the demo deploy you can leave this unset — `/dashboard` will show
a friendly "backend not reachable" notice.

## Refreshing the captured demo

The demo replay reads two static JSON bundles from
`apps/web/public/demo/`:

- `btc-120k-approve.json` — full council approval scenario
- `btc-120k-restraint.json` — Zeus veto / Proof of Restraint scenario

To regenerate them with a real Gemini deliberation (when quota allows):

```bash
uv run python tests/capture_demo_trace.py
```

To rebuild the curated bundles (verdict + paper trade are still computed
by the real Areopagus and Strategos code paths):

```bash
uv run python tests/build_demo_traces.py
```

Then commit the updated JSON and push — Vercel auto-redeploys.

## Local preview

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @athean/web dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Cost

Vercel Hobby tier:

- Bandwidth: 100 GB / month
- Build minutes: 6000 / month
- Serverless invocations: 100k / month

A demo site with a few hundred visitors per month sits well inside
free.

"""Manifold Markets — free play-money prediction market.

Manifold has 30k+ binary markets, generous public API, CC-BY-SA data.
Useful as:

  * A real-time *human consensus* prior on the same questions
    Polymarket prices. The gap between Manifold consensus and
    Polymarket implied is a calibration signal — not direct alpha,
    but a useful cross-check before sizing.

  * A *backtest substrate*. Manifold has resolved markets with
    known outcomes that we can replay through the Boule council to
    measure Brier score against play-money-but-incentivised humans.

API docs: https://docs.manifold.markets/api
No key required for read-only endpoints.

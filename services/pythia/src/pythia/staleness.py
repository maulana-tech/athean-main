"""Staleness aggregation utilities — quantify how old fused snapshots are.

A single market snapshot is built by composing data from several sources
(Polymarket book, CoinGecko price, news, Reddit). We surface the worst-case
staleness so Areopagus can hard-gate any signal whose data backbone has
drifted past policy.

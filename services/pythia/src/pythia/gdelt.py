"""GDELT 2.0 Document API — real-time global event signal.

GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) catalogues news
events from print + broadcast + web across 100+ languages with 15-min
update cadence ([gdeltproject.org](https://www.gdeltproject.org/)).
The 2.0 Document API exposes filtered article timelines with no key
required — free and rate-limited at the IP level (a few hundred calls
per minute is fine).

Three use cases we care about:

  1. ``article_timeline(query, hours=24)`` — counts of articles
     matching a free-text or themed query over the past N hours.
     A leading indicator for any market where the volume of coverage
     should track resolution probability.

  2. ``tone_timeline(query, hours=24)`` — average GDELT tone across
     matched articles. Tone is GDELT's news-sentiment score in
     ``[-100, +100]``. Useful as input to Cassandra's tail-risk reads.

  3. ``geopolitical_risk(country_code, hours=72)`` — composite score
     combining tone + article volume + theme keywords (PROTEST,
     MILITARY_CONFLICT, etc.) for a given country. Used by Apollo's
     ``geopolitical_risk_score`` feature on world-event markets.

Why this matters: a 2025 arxiv paper applied GDELT + FinBERT to FX
trading and reported out-of-sample Sharpe 5.87 on EUR/USD and 4.65 on
USD/JPY ([arxiv.org/abs/2505.16136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16136)).
The signal exists in public data; the alpha is in the *extraction*.
This module gives the wiring; the extraction is up to the operator.

For very-large historical pulls, use the BigQuery dataset (1TB/month
free on Google Cloud) instead — see docs/FEES_AND_EDGE.md for the
pointer.

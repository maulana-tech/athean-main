"""The Odds API — consensus sportsbook + politics odds.

`https://the-odds-api.com/` exposes a free-tier REST API that
aggregates pre-game odds across 70+ US + UK + EU sportsbooks. The
500 requests/month free tier is enough to refresh ~16/day with
generous over-cache, which suits our use case: we don't need every
tick, just the consensus implied probability at decision time.

Why this matters for Pantheon: many Polymarket markets re-list events
that already trade on conventional sportsbooks (NFL outcomes,
election outcomes when shifted to "will X win" form, World Cup,
boxing finals). The spread between Polymarket's implied probability
and the sportsbook consensus implied probability is a *clean basis*
that drives the basis-arb signal in Apollo.

Implied probability conversion:

  - American odds  (+150, -110)  → 100 / (odds + 100) for positive,
                                   -odds / (-odds + 100) for negative
  - Decimal odds   (2.50)        → 1 / odds
  - Vig-free probability         → divide each outcome's raw implied
                                   by the sum across outcomes

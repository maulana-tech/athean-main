"""Reflection-driven prompt evolution.

The Underworld owns post-mortems: it knows which trades failed and why.
When the same failure pattern repeats often enough, we want to evolve
the responsible agent's system prompt to internalise the lesson rather
than relying on humans to notice the trend.

Pipeline:

  broken_assumptions  ->  derive_lessons  ->  propose_edits  -> moirai gate
                                                                |
                                                                v
                                                          apply_edit
                                                          (append marker block
                                                          to agent prompt .md)

Edits are deterministic, idempotent, and audit-friendly. We never
rewrite existing prompt text — we append a single marker-delimited
``## Lessons Learned`` block. If the block already exists, edits are
merged into it; duplicate suggestions are skipped.

"""Settlement watcher — polls Polymarket for resolved markets and books PnL.

Argos watches open positions for exits *during* a market's life. The
settlement watcher handles the terminal event: once a market resolves, we
mark all trades against it as settled, compute realised PnL, and emit an
``ostrakon`` score event so agent credibility weights can update.

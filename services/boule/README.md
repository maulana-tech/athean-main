# Boule — Deliberation Council

Multi-agent AI council that debates every potential trade before execution.

## What It Does

1. Receives S/A band `Signal`s from Apollo
2. Spawns an 11-agent voting council (each a Claude / Gemini / OpenAI / etc. call with a specialised system prompt; the prompts live under `prompts/`)
3. Runs 4-round structured debate: opening → challenge → synthesis → vote
4. Produces a signed `Thesis` with consensus probability, recommended size, and exit conditions
5. Emits full `TraceEvent` stream per deliberation

## Setup

```bash
cd services/boule
cp .env.example .env
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
uv run python -m boule.orchestrator
```

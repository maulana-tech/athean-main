"""Eris — the adversarial dissenter against emerging consensus.

Eris reads the round-2 transcript, infers the direction the council is
leaning, and argues the opposite case as forcefully as the evidence
allows. The intent is to restore dispersion that vanishes once a
deliberation cascades.

See ``services/boule/src/boule/prompts/eris.md`` for the prompt
contract that governs her behaviour at runtime.

"""Auditor — replays a debate and emits anomaly observations.

The auditor is a post-hoc reviewer. Given a finished Thesis, it scans
agent votes for: confidence/probability inconsistency, flagged tail
risks that nobody else echoed, agents who voted opposite the council
direction. Findings flow back to Underworld for post-mortem context.

"""Apollo signal scorer — turns a Pythia market snapshot into a typed Signal.

Inputs are intentionally narrow: every adapter from Pythia projects its raw
payload into a ``MarketSnapshot`` before reaching the scorer, so this module
only has to do math, not source-specific parsing. The scorer applies edge
calculation, band classification, and assembles the final ``Signal`` model
that downstream services consume.

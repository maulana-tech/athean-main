"""Arc-anchored reasoning-trace bundles.

The Boule council emits a stream of structured ``TraceEvent``s per
deliberation — round openings, challenges, the Athena synthesis, votes,
and the final verdict. Today these traces live in Redis + IPFS; this
module makes them *publicly verifiable on chain*:

  1. Take an in-memory list of TraceEvents for one deliberation.
  2. Canonicalise them with ``parthenon.hash.canonical_json``.
  3. Compute a keccak256 ``bundle_hash`` over the canonical bytes.
  4. Produce a deterministic ``TraceBundle`` ready for IPFS pinning
     (via ``parthenon.ipfs``) and on-chain anchoring (via a thin
     Arc transaction that just emits the hash + CID).
  5. Optionally include a deliberation-time witness (``signed_at``,
     model fingerprint, agent set) so future re-runs are auditable.

Why this matters: the reasoning trace itself is the artifact, not
just the resulting trade. Hashing the trace onto Arc at ~$0.01/tx
makes it publicly verifiable without eroding PnL. Other agents (or
auditors) can later replay the trace and check that the council's
declared reasoning still matches the model output it produced.

Mechanics:

  * No new Solidity contract for now — the existing
    ``ProofOfRestraint`` event pattern is reused for trace anchoring.
    A dedicated ``TraceRegistry`` with structured fields is on the
    roadmap; today we use the off-chain bundle + a thin anchor
    receipt that lands on Arc.
  * The bundle is IPFS-friendly (canonical JSON, byte-stable).
  * ``TraceAnchor.to_anchor_payload()`` is the minimal struct an
    on-chain anchoring tx needs: ``(thesis_id, bundle_hash, cid_v0)``.
